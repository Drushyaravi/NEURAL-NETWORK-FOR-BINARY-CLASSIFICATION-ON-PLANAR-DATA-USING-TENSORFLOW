# NEURAL-NETWORK-FOR-BINARY-CLASSIFICATION-ON-PLANAR-DATA-USING-TENSORFLOW

This repository contains a neural network implementation in TensorFlow for binary classification on planar data. The network is trained on a synthetic dataset generated using a circular decision boundary.

Files:
=======
neural_network.py: The main Python script containing the implementation of the neural network, including data generation, model definition, forward and backward propagation, and training.

Usage:
=========
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-planar-data.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install tensorflow
Run the script: python neural_network.py

Results:
=========
The script will generate a plot of the decision boundary learned by the neural network, along with the training data points.
